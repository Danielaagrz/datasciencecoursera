**Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set**
Data set: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

**Files:**

"CodeBook.md" - File in which each information about the data, the variables and the steps taken to analyze the date are described.

"run_analysis.R" - File in which first shows the data set being dowloaded and prepared for analysis, followed by 5 steps: 
      1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
      3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
      5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
